Welcome Message: The game starts with a welcoming message, displaying the title “ADVENTURE-GAME!” in teal green.

Opponents: You’ve created three opponents: Skeleton, Assassin, and Zombie. Their initial health values are set (150 for Assassin and 200 for Zombie).

Player Input: The user is prompted to enter their name and choose an opponent to fight.
Game Loop: The startGame function handles the game loop. It displays player and opponent health, checks for victory conditions, and prompts the user for actions (attack, heal, or run).

End Game: If either the player or opponent’s health reaches zero, the game ends. The winner is displayed, and the user is asked if they want to play again.
